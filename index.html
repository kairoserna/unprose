<h3>Garden</h3>

<p>When it rains, I bloom
And crimson reigns inside the room
Behind my eyes- it’s spilling out
I feel within and feel without
When it rains, I open
Up my petals, vaguely hoping
In the pale room I am straining
To remove the shameful staining
To maintain the throbbing lie?
When it rains, I bloom and die.</p>
